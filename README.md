## Why?

To learn intricacies of ML. ML is not a statistical method when dealing with data. I see it as a means to get some result through methodical data morphology. Results and my inference is what makes a good data analysis. To ensure that I am able to see through ML well enough that I can focus in honing inferential skills. I am developing this project.
