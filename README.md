# auto-sklearn

This package will help you perform ML on __ANY__ tabular data. The result of modelling will be a weighted network describing which features were associated with which modelling method. This will help you understand:

- Feature Bias
- Useless Features
- Co-dependency of Features
- PCA efficiency

## Installation

To install the package, you can use `pip` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto-sklearn.git
cd auto-sklearn
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (OPTIONAL)

You can set the environment's name as you wish by replacing `auto-env`.

```bash
python -m venv auto-env
source auto-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: auto-env\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing the Package

Note that the `-e` flag is important.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Verify the Install

```bash
import auto-sklearn
```

## Why?

To learn intricacies of ML. ML is not a statistical method when dealing with data. I see it as a means to get some result through methodical data morphology. Results and my inference is what makes a good data analysis. To ensure that I am able to see through ML well enough that I can focus in honing inferential skills.

I am developing this project to blaze through basic modelling when I want to:

- Test new datasets.
- Experiment with modelling methods.
- Compare modelling with Deep Learning etc.

Finally, this package will help me write a Data Science blog in a very short time by reducing preliminary data testing time. This inturn helps me focus on novelty and creative aspects of Data Science. I also get to learn new areas of DS in a weekly basis.
